    <h1>Happy 2nd Anniversary, My AK! ðŸ’–</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Iâ€™m sorry for the times when Iâ€™ve been difficult. I truly love you, and I give you my word that Iâ€™ll work on being better. Starting with being more in tune with you and mirroring things in a way that brings us closer. I love you, and I appreciate you more than words can express. I will always be grateful for having you in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being in a long-distance relationship is definitely not easy. I used to think it would be simple, but over time, I've realized that I was wrong. Even so, Iâ€™m still confident about us, just with a deeper understanding. I hope that one day we can be together in personâ€”waking up next to you, sharing quiet mornings with you, and giving you good morning kisses.
        </p>
        <p>
            I miss all the things we used to do together, but I know this distance is part of our journey. Everything thatâ€™s been happening between us feels like itâ€™s meant to be. Maybe itâ€™s to help us be even more certain about our love, regardless of the obstacles we face along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know you're busy, and so am I. I often feel overstimulated and exhausted, and I see how active and happy you are. I know youâ€™ve got things going too, and I hope you're not feeling as strained as I sometimes do. I love you, and I hope you can feel that in everything I do. I hope you know just how much you mean to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't wait to see you. I'm so excited about our future and the success of our love. I get so kilig just imagining you as my driver when I need to go to places or even when I'm heading to the office. Just like how youâ€™ve always been there for me, supporting me through every step of my journeyâ€”thank you for that, baby.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you and I miss you  x10<sup>9</sup>. I dream of holding your hand as I sign a contract, just like you used to hold my hand when I studied, back when you were still here with me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, happy 2nd anniversary to us. Here's to many more moments together. ðŸ’–
